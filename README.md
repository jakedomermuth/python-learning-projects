# Python-Learning-Projects
In my efforts to master Python, I have decided that creating projects is the best way for me to learn. This repository will contain all the projects I make along the way. It will also include some information about each project, what I learned, and a difficulty rating.


## Project 1: [Tech-With-Tim-Follow](https://github.com/jakedomermuth/python-learning-projects/blob/main/Tech-With_Time_Follow.py)
For my first project, I decided to do a follow-along. While I plan on creating my own projects in the future, I believe this helped me understand how to plan for creating a project. In this follow-along, I was a little confused with how the game was built. However, I learned a lot about ensuring you are taking in good input, and building/calling functions. 

## Project 2: [Mad-Libs-Project](https://github.com/jakedomermuth/python-learning-projects/blob/main/Mad-Libs-Project.py)
This is the first project of this series that I created by myself. I am creating projects from the Udemy course "30 Great Python Projects to Help You Master it in 2024". With this project, I watched it run once and then attempted to replicate it (with some of my own personal touches) without watching the tutorial. I was very happy that I was able to do this. I did realize after watching the tutorial that I could have just used one function that takes a "word type" argument. This is a pleasant reminder to try and think more dynamically when working on these projects.
Difficulty Level: Easy
