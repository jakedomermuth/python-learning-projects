# Python-Learning-Projects
In my efforts to master Python, I have decided that creating projects is the best way for me to learn. This repository will contain all the projects I make along the way. It will also include some information about each project, what I learned, and a difficulty rating.


## Project 1: [Tech-With-Tim-Follow](https://github.com/jakedomermuth/python-learning-projects/blob/main/Tech-With_Time_Follow.py)
For my first project, I decided to do a follow-along. While I plan on creating my own projects in the future, I believe this helped me understand how to plan for creating a project. In this follow-along, I was a little confused with how the game was built. However, I learned a lot about ensuring you are taking in good input, and building/calling functions. 

## Project 2: [Mad-Libs-Project](https://github.com/jakedomermuth/python-learning-projects/blob/main/Mad-Libs-Project.py)
This is the first project of this series that I created by myself. I am creating projects from the Udemy course "30 Great Python Projects to Help You Master it in 2024". With this project, I watched it run once and then attempted to replicate it (with some of my own personal touches) without watching the tutorial. I was very happy that I was able to do this. I did realize after watching the tutorial that I could have just used one function that takes a "word type" argument. This is a pleasant reminder to try and think more dynamically when working on these projects.
Difficulty Level: Easy

## Project 3: [Number-Guessing-Game](Number-Guessing-Game.py)
This project is also a part of the Udemy Series. I am very excited about this project because I was able to finish it myself and add additional features such as setting a limit on the amount of guesses a user can have. I also got to use skills I gained from the "Tech-With-Tim" follow-along. In that follow-along, I learned about creating infinite loops to ensure a user gives you the input you want. After I completed this, I watched the tutorial and it used Try and Except for gathering input. It was interesting to see how many different ways a simple game can be created. 
Difficulty Level: Easy

## Project 4: [Dice Simulator](Dice-Simulator.py)
This project was very similar to the previous two. However, I still feel  I learned a lot. I got stuck a couple of times, but I was able to finish it without using the tutorial. However, I believe the tutorial was very beneficial because it simplified the project heavily by adding the values to a list.
