# Python-Learning-Projects
In my efforts to master Python, I have decided that creating projects is the best way for me to learn.This repository will contain all the projects I make along the way. It will also include some information about each project and what I learned.


## Project 1:
For my first project, I decided to do a follow-along. While I plan on creating my own projects in the future, I believe this helped me understand how to plan for creating a project. In this follow-along, I was a little confused with how the game was built. However, I learned a lot about ensuring you are taking in good input, and building/calling functions.
